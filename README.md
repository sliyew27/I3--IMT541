# Weather Comparison: Addis Ababa vs Seattle (April 17â€“27, 2025)

## Overview

This project presents a comparison of maximum and minimum daily temperatures between Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Seattle, Washington for the period April 17 to April 27, 2025. The analysis is based on structured weather data compiled in CSV format and visualized through Python. The primary objective is to provide a clear graphical representation of temperature variations between the two cities over the selected timeframe.
