# I3 : Weather Data Comparison: Addis Ababa & Seattle (April 17–27, 2025)

## Overview

This project uses two CSV datasets containing 10 days of weather data for **Addis Ababa, Ethiopia** and **Seattle, Washington, USA**, from **April 17 to April 27, 2025**. The datasets include daily **maximum and minimum temperatures (in Fahrenheit)** and **precipitation levels**.

The goal of this project is to **create visual graphs** comparing the temperature and precipitation trends between the two cities over the same time period. This comparison aims to illustrate weather differences across vastly different climates and geographic regions.
