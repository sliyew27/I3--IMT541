# I3 : Weather Data Comparison: Addis Ababa & Seattle (April 17–27, 2025)

## Overview

This project uses two CSV datasets containing 10 days of weather data for **Addis Ababa, Ethiopia** and **Seattle, Washington, USA**, from **April 17 to April 27, 2025**. The datasets include daily **maximum and minimum temperatures (in Fahrenheit)** and **precipitation levels**.

The goal of this project is to **create visual graphs** comparing the temperature and precipitation trends between the two cities over the same time period. This comparison aims to illustrate weather differences across vastly different climates and geographic regions.

### Files in This Project

- `addis_weather_apr_17_27.csv`: Contains 10 days of weather data for Addis Ababa.
- `seattle_weather_apr_17_27.csv`: Contains 10 days of weather data for Seattle.

Each file includes:
- `date`: The date of the recorded data.
- `tempmin_f`: Minimum temperature (°F)
- `tempmax_f`: Maximum temperature (°F)
- `precipitation`: Precipitation in inches

## Instructions

This section will guide you through the process of:
1. Preparing the data in Python.
2. Creating a graph comparing the temperature ranges for both cities.
3. Creating a graph comparing precipitation levels for both cities.
4. Reflecting on the visual results and writing up observations.

*Next step coming soon.*
